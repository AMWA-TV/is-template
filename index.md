This is a template that we recommend using as a starting point for new NMOS Specifications.

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal (template) specification is provided at in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-template). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The documenation and API links immediately below, and the links in the page heading, are for an example development branch. Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or under "VERSIONS..." in the page heading.

Once AMWA has approved a Specification, its documentation and API links will be for the _most recent approved release_ (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo).
